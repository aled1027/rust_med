# Authentication Implementation Plan

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

**Status**: All phases have been successfully implemented and tested. The authentication system is fully functional.

We've successfully added authentication to the app. Auth information is stored in a file named auth.json in the app data directory. 

## Auth File Structure

The auth.json file will be structured like this:
```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "user_id": "alice",
  "kdf": {
    "algorithm": "argon2id",
    "salt": "base64-encoded-salt",
    "params": {
      "memory_kib": 65536,
      "iterations": 3,
      "parallelism": 2
    }
  },
  "user": {
    "username": "aled1027"
  },
  "wrapped_dek": {
    "algorithm": "aes-256-gcm",
    "nonce": "base64-encoded-nonce",
    "ciphertext": "base64-encoded-ciphertext",
    "tag": "optional-base64-tag-if-separated"
  },
  "created_at": "2025-10-08T14:21:00Z",
  "last_password_change": "2025-10-08T14:21:00Z"
}
```

## Authentication Workflow ✅ IMPLEMENTED

1. ✅ When the app opens, check if the auth.json file exists.
2. ✅ If auth.json doesn't exist: show the user a registration form for their username and password. Have them create those things and store it in this file.
3. ✅ Then authenticate the user automatically after registration.
4. ✅ If the file auth.json does exist, ask the user for their password (show their username), and then authenticate the password against the file.
5. ✅ On success: authenticate the user and show the main app.
6. ✅ On failure, tell the user the issue (wrong password) and let them try again.
